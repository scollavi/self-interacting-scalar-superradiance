# Analysis Code
The code used for analysing the results of the simulation code, and generating the plots in the paper. The code is split into the different scripts for Cygnus X-1's two ages, and MOA-2011. Also included are the processed data used in this analysis.

To run the analysis code, use the .ipynb files. These should be self-explanatory with the comments/other documentation therein. Other files (such as o2-psd-H1L1.txt) are inputs to the analysis files.

N.B.: The analysis code makes use of the tools in the SimulationCode folder; changing the structure of the files in a cloned repository will require modification to the analysis code to run.
