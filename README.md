## Explanation of Constituents
### Simulation Code
The code used for simulating the ultralight-scalar/black hole interactions, and processing it for data analysis (presentation of GW strains, drifts, etc.)
### Analysis Code
The code used for analysing the results of the simulation code, and generating the plots in the paper. The code is split into the different scripts for Cygnus X-1's two ages, and MOA-2011.

Also included are the processed data used in this analysis.
### Raw Data
The raw data produced from the last mass estimate of the simulations.
